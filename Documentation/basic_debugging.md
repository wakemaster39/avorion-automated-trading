# Opening up the console menu

By pressing the `'`, the console menu will overlay the screen. Pressing it again it will hide it again.
Using this screen, you are able to see script failures (syntax, raised errors, etc) and print statements.
This is incredibly important and useful for figuring out how to make things work.
