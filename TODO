* Need to implement a "Sector Manager" esque screen
** Screen should allow you to build a trade filter
** Trade filter should be able to select an item and apply a rule to purchase
** Rules should be something like
*** Mining Robots < 10% market value
*** Any < 30% market value and current inventory < $$$$$$
** Need to be able to set a Maximum Cargo value, if carrying $$$ don't buy only sell

* Need to implement serialization for the storage of the trade filters

* With Trade Filters added, tie into the MapCommands and add a new screen like buy order
** When clicking trade, select the filter you wish to be using

* Implement the actual trade logic last, mostly copy pasta from the actual trade scripts
